/*
Abstraction -> implementation hiding, don't seperate it from encapsulation, dono ko seperate nahi kr skte 
they overlap with each other, it overlaps with all 3 pillars

-> encapsulation is a subset of "ABSTRACTION"

if you call them like this (sirf theory main number milege is tarike se)
Encapsulation - Data hiding
abstraction -  impelementation hiding


DO NOT EXPLAIN THIS IN THE INTERVIEW, IT'S CORRECT BUT NOT FROM A LEARNING PERSPECTIVE, ITS CONFUSING

encapsulation is a subset of abstraction

-> Abstraction can be achieved by access modifiers just like encapsulation



you can't differentiate between them because jab aapne implementation kre aapne object and class bnai, toh encapsulation toh apne aap achieve ho gayi

there is not coding example to seperate abstraction and encapsulation



example - sort* a = new qucksort();

ab hamne end user ko srt nam ka pointer pakdta dia usko nahi pta konsi sorting technique use hui h, usko nahi pta konsi implementation use hui h 
so we can say this is abstraction and, you used the concept of class and  objects toh encapsulation toh vese ho hogayi use


confusion hori h toh you can explicity say ki they both everlap each other


INTERVIEW SE BOL SKTE H

abstraction -> generalisation (key keyword)
encapsulation -> parent wrap up

encapsulation - > mere paas ek theli h usme bohot saari cheeze h aur vo theli maine pakad li, so basically its wrapping or encapsulation -> you are wrapping data
Abstraction - > maine ek sort type ka printer bnaya and maine vo user ko pakda dia ek generic form main, maine nahi btaya ki konsa sort use kr rhe h
we are basically teying to achieve generalisation by hiding  implementation of various algorithms.


we are putting books in a bag - > encapsulation 
but we are saying this bag contains book, without specifying the books - > abstraction


hmare paas, purse h, jiske andar paise h alag alog type ke - encapsulation
but purse ke andr paise h without telling ki ko kon se notes h is-  abstraction
 

 INTERVIEW QUESTION 

 what is the different between compile time and run time polymorphism

 inheritance - diamond problem 

 abstraction and encapsulation - difference - or chalta firta examole  - sorting wala de skte ho
